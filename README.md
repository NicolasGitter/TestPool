Born to deal with tempary things.

    Hellowie!dudes.This is my 1st time to experience mygit.Though I had a git account earlier,which is totally different from this time.For now I had spent nearly an hour to experience.At the first beginning,I exit from GitHub after finishing my registry.But now I've decided to make a new change for my programming career!
